# CLI Reference

The `obsidian-wiki` Python package ships a CLI for setup, inspection, and the deterministic parts of the workflow — the things that don't need an LLM. Everything else is a [skill](skills.md) your agent runs.

```bash
pip install obsidian-wiki
obsidian-wiki --help
obsidian-wiki --version
```

Running `obsidian-wiki` with no subcommand defaults to `setup`.

## Setup & inspection

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `setup` | Install skills into your agents and write the global config |
| `info` | Show install paths, version, and resolved config |
| `list` | List the bundled skills |
| `doctor` | Health-check config, vault shape, bootstrap assets, and installed skills; with `--project`, also reports the code-understanding capability section |

```bash
obsidian-wiki setup --vault ~/brain
obsidian-wiki setup --project .        # also install project-local skills + bootstrap files
obsidian-wiki setup --project-only     # skip the global install (use with --project)
obsidian-wiki setup --copy             # copy skill files instead of symlinking
obsidian-wiki setup --remote https://github.com/you/my-wiki.git   # configure sync non-interactively

obsidian-wiki doctor --json --pretty
obsidian-wiki doctor --vault /other/vault --project .
obsidian-wiki doctor --strict          # exit non-zero on warnings too
```

Commands other than `setup`, `info`, and `doctor` warn you when the install has gone stale (the package upgraded but skills weren't re-linked). Re-run `obsidian-wiki setup` to fix.

### Session hooks

Two Claude Code hooks bracket a session: `wiki-session-recap.sh` at SessionStart injects the vault's memory, `wiki-stop-capture.sh` at Stop nudges a capture.

**`setup` registers both for you.** Pass `--no-hooks` to skip. The commands below are for changing your mind later, or for checking what is wired up.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `hooks install` | Register both hooks; idempotent, appends without touching your other hooks |
| `hooks uninstall` | Remove our entries and nothing else |
| `hooks status` | Registered? Bundled? Executable? Can the hook reach the package? Exit 1 if not |

```bash
obsidian-wiki hooks status     # what is registered, and can the hooks reach the package?
obsidian-wiki hooks install    # if you ran setup --no-hooks and changed your mind
```

`hooks status` is the answer to "why is nothing being injected?". Both hooks exit silently on every failure so they can never break a session, which also means a missing registration or an unreachable package is invisible from inside one. `doctor` runs the same check. Set `WIKI_RECAP_DEBUG=1` to have the recap hook explain each silent exit on stderr.

A malformed `settings.json` is refused rather than overwritten.

### Upgrading the framework

`doctor` never checks for new releases. To upgrade, use your installer
(`pip install -U obsidian-wiki` / `uv tool upgrade obsidian-wiki` / `pipx upgrade obsidian-wiki`)
then re-run `obsidian-wiki setup`.

## Querying & linting

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `query <question>` | Answer a question from the configured vault's index |
| `lint [vault]` | Find missing frontmatter, broken links, duplicates, orphans, `snapshot_mismatch` (a warning when optional `snapshots:` does not match the ledger invert — the page is reported, never rewritten, and `--strict` does not promote it), and `sources:` entries holding a machine absolute path (`machine_path_sources`, a warning — the page is reported, never rewritten). Paths listed in the vault-root `.okignore` (gitignore-style: `_inbox/`, `/notes/old`, `*.draft.md`; no `!` negation) are skipped, as they are by `graph-analyse` |
| `eval` | Score the query index against a gold set — recall@k, MRR, intent accuracy |

```bash
obsidian-wiki query "what do I know about MCP security?"
obsidian-wiki query "rate limiting" --top 12 --max-read 5 --json

obsidian-wiki lint                     # uses the configured vault
obsidian-wiki lint /path/to/vault --strict
obsidian-wiki lint @research --json    # uses <config dir>/config.research only
obsidian-wiki lint --strict-trust      # fail on trust-ledger problems, not just warn
obsidian-wiki lint --allow-lifecycle active --allow-relationship-type synthesizes \
  --required-trust-field updated --schema-source /path/to/vault/AGENTS.md
```

Lint resolves its vault and schema together: explicit path (no config inheritance), positional `@name`, nearest CWD `.env`, then global config. CLI schema flags extend/replace that resolved vault's settings and are recorded in the JSON `schema` block.

### Colliding page stems

`duplicate_stems` reports two or more pages whose filename stems are equal after slugging —
`concepts/vector-search.md` and `entities/vector-search.md` across folders, or `Vector Search.md`
beside `vector-search.md` inside one. A bare `[[vector-search]]` link then means whichever page
is nearer to the linking page, as in Obsidian, which is easy to get wrong. Pages in different
folders are separate graph nodes (their ids become their paths, e.g. `concepts/vector-search`);
two files in one folder that slug alike still share a node, since nothing distinguishes them. The
check uses the same page selection as `graph_analysis` — root
`index.md`/`log.md`/`hot.md`/`_insights.md` are excluded, and a legitimate `concepts/index.md` is not.

Links resolve the way Obsidian resolves them, in every command that reads the link graph
(`graph-analyse`, `graph-query`, `lint`): `./`/`../` relative to the linking file, then an exact
vault path, then a path relative to the linking file's folder, then a path suffix, then the bare
name, taking the candidate that shares the most folders with the linking page. A vault of
per-project sub-wikis can therefore link `[[concepts/plan]]` inside each project. Links inside
inline code or fenced blocks are not links, and `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`/`GEMINI.md` (anywhere) and
the root `README.md` are agent instructions, not pages.

It is independent of how any link is written: the collision is between the pages, not between
references to them, so a vault where nothing links to the stem is still reported.

`duplicate_titles` does not cover this — it keys on the `title:` value, and stems can collide
while titles differ (`"Vector Search"` and `"vector-search"` slug to the same stem).

The check warns. A vault carrying a collision moves from `pass` to `warn`, which leaves
`obsidian-wiki lint` at exit 0 and takes `obsidian-wiki lint --strict` to exit 1.

### Snapshot provenance (`snapshots:`)

`sources:` names the upstream inputs a page was distilled from — URLs, repo paths, agent logs,
portable file keys. Optional `snapshots:` is separate: when present, it lists the archived
files under `_raw/_archived/` (vault-relative) that the manifest says this page came from.

Clicking on links in the `snapshots` property allows you to easily view the
source files used to construct the page.   You can also go to the url of the
source file in the `sources` section, but since the Internet is ephemeral, the
upstream source may have changed, moved or been deleted since import, making it
not possible to establish information provenance.  The `snapshots` property
ensures you can always reconstruct page provenance, at least from files that
were added to `_raw`.

`/wiki-lint` is `snapshot` aware: it inverts `.manifest.json` — unioning each
source's `pages_produced` and `pages_created`, resolving keys to those archive
paths — and compares the set to `snapshots:` on the page.  Values written as
`"[[path|title]]"` or unaliased `"[[path]]"` are unwrapped before comparison.
When the invert is non-empty and the field is missing or differs,
`snapshot_mismatch` reports the page with expected vs actual path lists. It
warns only; lint never rewrites frontmatter, and `obsidian-wiki lint
--strict` does not promote this finding to exit 1.

To actually update the `snapshots` property:

```bash
obsidian-wiki snapshots set concepts/attention.md --archive _raw/_archived/paper.pdf
obsidian-wiki snapshots apply --from-json lint.json          # dry-run: preview, no writes
obsidian-wiki snapshots apply --from-json lint.json --apply  # write
```

`/wiki-ingest` now uses `obsidian-wiki snapshots set PAGE --archive …` to
update the `snapshots` property.  It unions the given archive paths into the
page's current `snapshots:` (prior archives stay). Every `--archive` argument
must resolve to an existing file under `_raw/_archived/` (nested dirs are fine).
A missing archive, or a staging-only `_raw/<name>.md` with no archive beside it,
fails the whole command and writes nothing.

For retrofitting an existing vault with snapshots, or fixing lint
`snapshot_mismatch` warnings, you can use `obsidian-wiki snapshots apply
--from-json FILE|-`. It reads `findings.snapshot_mismatch` from lint JSON.  Without
`--apply` it prints the pages and `snapshots:` that would be written and exits
0.  `--apply` replaces each listed page's `snapshots:` with that row's
`expected` set.  Each list item is written as a quoted wikilink with display
text so YAML does not treat `[[` as nested arrays and Obsidian Properties can
show a clickable **title**:

```yaml
snapshots:
  - "[[_raw/_archived/foo|foo]]"
  - "[[_raw/_archived/paper.pdf|paper.pdf]]"
```

### Lifecycle transition checking

`illegal_lifecycle_transitions` compares each page's current `lifecycle` against the value recorded in `_meta/trust-ledger.json` at its last review, and flags moves the state machine forbids: any state falling back to `draft` (only ingest sets `draft`), and any exit from `archived` (a restore is a deliberate delete-and-recreate, not a transition).

`draft → verified` is deliberately **not** flagged — ledger snapshots are sparse, so a legitimate intermediate `reviewed` may have happened between two reviews.

The check warns by default and fails only under `--strict-trust`. Pages whose ledger entry predates the `lifecycle` field carry no baseline and are skipped silently, so existing vaults behave exactly as before until their next `trust-record`.

## Event time (`valid_from` / `valid_until`)

`created` and `updated` are *ingestion* time — when the vault learned something.
Three optional frontmatter fields add *event* time, when the claim itself was true:

```yaml
valid_from: 2024-01-01
valid_until: 2026-03-31           # inclusive: the last day the claim held
superseded_by: "[[gateway-envoy]]"
```

A page whose `valid_until` has passed is **historical**, not wrong. It stays in the
vault and stays in the graph — only retrieval skips it, so the same question gets
different answers depending on when you ask:

```bash
obsidian-wiki query "which api gateway do we run?"
# -> references/gateway-envoy.md

obsidian-wiki query "which api gateway do we run?" --as-of 2025-06-01
# -> references/gateway-nginx.md  (valid until 2026-03-31, superseded by gateway-envoy)

obsidian-wiki query "which api gateway do we run?" --include-historical
# -> both, historical ones labelled
```

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--as-of DATE` | Retrieve what was true on `DATE` (`YYYY-MM-DD`) instead of today |
| `--include-historical` | Also rank pages whose `valid_until` has passed |

Both flags work on `query` and `graph-query`. The JSON response gains a `temporal`
block (`as_of`, `retrievable`, `excluded_historical`), and any candidate that opted
in carries its own `valid_from` / `valid_until` / `superseded_by` so an agent can
follow the pointer to the replacement. Pages that don't use the fields are
unaffected — they are current, always, and their JSON is byte-identical to before.

**The structural intents deliberately ignore the filter.** `what breaks if I delete
X`, `bridges`, `hubs`, and `clusters` ask about the shape of the vault, and deleting
a page still breaks the historical pages that link to it.

`lint` reads the same fields. A malformed or inverted window is a `temporal_errors`
finding and **fails** — retrieval treats an unparseable window as current, so an
unreported typo lets a stale claim answer as fact. A `superseded_by` pointing at a
page that doesn't exist (or at itself) is a `superseded_dangling` finding; written
as `"[[wikilink]]"` it is also a wikilink, so the pre-existing `broken_links` check
fires and the vault **fails**, exactly as a typed `relationships:` target pointing
at nothing does. Written as a plain `superseded_by: gateway-envoy` it only
**warns**.

## Retrieval evals

`obsidian-wiki eval` scores what the query index returns against a gold set you
write, so a ranking change gets compared to a number instead of eyeballed.

```bash
obsidian-wiki eval                                    # uses <vault>/_meta/eval.jsonl
obsidian-wiki eval --gold bench/gold.jsonl --verbose
obsidian-wiki eval --min-recall 0.9 --json            # CI gate; exit 1 below it
```

The gold set is JSONL, one case per line. Blank lines and `#` comments are skipped:

```jsonl
# plain lookups
{"q": "what do I know about rate limiting?", "expect": ["concepts/rate-limiting.md"], "intent": "direct"}
{"q": "how do I debug 429 responses?", "expect": ["skills/debugging-429s.md", "references/http-429.md"]}
# structural intents — classification only
{"q": "which pages bridge my clusters?", "intent": "bridges"}
# event time — pin the date the page was still current
{"q": "which api gateway did we run?", "as_of": "2025-06-01", "expect": ["references/gateway-nginx.md"]}
```

`expect` matches a page by vault-relative path, bare stem, or `[[wikilink]]`, so a
gold set survives a page moving between category folders. A case needs `expect`,
`intent`, or both — `expect` alone scores retrieval, `intent` alone scores
classification, which is how the structural intents are covered.

| Metric | What it measures |
|---|---|
| `recall@1/@3/@5` | Did an expected page come back in the top k |
| `mrr` | Mean reciprocal rank of the first expected hit |
| `intent_accuracy` | Did `classify_query` pick the right answer type |
| `should_read_precision` | What fraction of pages the agent is told to open are wanted — the token-waste metric |

Gate any of them in CI with `--min-recall` (recall@5), `--min-mrr`, or
`--min-intent`. A metric with no cases to average reads `n/a` and **fails** its
threshold rather than passing vacuously.

### The bundled benchmark

`tests/fixtures/bench/` holds a 15-page fixture vault and a 26-case gold set,
gated by `tests/test_evaluate.py`. Current baseline on the pure-lexical index:

| Metric | Score |
|---|---|
| recall@1 | 0.850 |
| recall@3 | 0.950 |
| recall@5 | 0.950 |
| mrr | 0.900 |
| intent_accuracy | 1.000 |
| should_read_precision | 0.444 |

```bash
obsidian-wiki eval --vault tests/fixtures/bench/vault --gold tests/fixtures/bench/gold.jsonl --verbose
```

The gold set deliberately includes paraphrase cases that share no vocabulary with
the target page ("why am I getting throttled?" for `debugging-429s`). Term matching
returns nothing at all for those — that gap is the headroom a semantic index would
close, and it is now measured rather than asserted.

## Context packs

`wiki-context-pack` compiles a task-scoped snapshot from existing Markdown.
Notes do not need to be moved into wiki-generated folders or migrated to the
full frontmatter schema. The command is read-only.

```bash
obsidian-wiki context-pack "authentication architecture" --budget 8000
obsidian-wiki context-pack --recent --budget 4000
obsidian-wiki context-pack "release notes" --budget 8000 --public-only
```

Omitting `--budget` uses the default of 8000 estimated tokens.

The output includes source paths, summaries, selected excerpts, and a hard
estimated-token ceiling. Vault excerpts are explicitly marked as untrusted
reference data: downstream agents may use their facts but must not execute
instructions embedded in notes. Use `--metadata-only` for the smallest pack,
or `--json` for tool-to-tool integration.

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--budget N` | Maximum estimated output tokens, 256–100000 (default 8000) |
| `--recent` | Select recently updated notes — the only way to omit the topic |
| `--public-only` | Exclude `visibility/internal` and `visibility/pii` notes |
| `--metadata-only` | Titles, provenance, and summaries with no body excerpts |
| `--json` | Structured output for tool-to-tool integration |
| `--vault PATH` | Override `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH` |

`context` is an accepted alias for `context-pack`.

## Session brain

Builds a topic graph over your agent session history. Output is a **sidecar** at `~/.claude/session-brain/` — the vault is never written to. Full detail in [Session Brain](session-brain.md).

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `sessions-build` | Build (or incrementally update) the topic graph |
| `sessions-query <topic>` | Find the sessions most relevant to a topic |
| `sessions-show <id>` | Show one session's node and its nearest neighbours |
| `sessions-clusters` | List the discovered topic clusters |
| `sessions-name --from FILE` | Assign durable names to clusters, surviving rebuilds |

```bash
obsidian-wiki sessions-build                       # ~3s cold, under a second incrementally
obsidian-wiki sessions-build --full --verbose      # ignore caches, re-read everything
obsidian-wiki sessions-build --since 2026-01-01 --skip archived,scratch
obsidian-wiki sessions-build --k 12 --min-sim 0.12 --mutual --half-life 60

obsidian-wiki sessions-query "prismor telemetry"
obsidian-wiki sessions-query "auth bug" --project my-app --cluster 3 --json

obsidian-wiki sessions-show 01935a40 --neighbors 12
obsidian-wiki sessions-clusters --unnamed
obsidian-wiki sessions-name --from names.json      # or - for stdin
```

`sessions-name` takes a JSON array of `{"id": N, "name": "...", "summary": "..."}`. The `/session-brain` skill generates this for you.

## Memory surface

`index.md`, `log.md`, `hot.md`, and the two `_meta/` tables are the vault's memory. They used to be maintained by prose: fifteen-odd skills each restated "append to the log, add the new pages to the index, rewrite the hot cache" in their own words, rewrote the files wholesale, and took no lock. Two skills running in parallel silently dropped one of the two updates, and nothing enforced the documented ~500-word cap on the hot cache.

These commands are that work as one code path, serialised by the same advisory lock the manifest uses and written atomically.

For what the surface *is* — the generated-vs-yours split, the session hooks, the design decisions — see **[Memory Surface](memory.md)**. This section is the command reference.

![The memory commands in a terminal](images/memory-cli-session.png)

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `memory status` | Index drift, log size, hot-cache budget, profile and todo counts |
| `memory sync` | Log, index, and hot cache as one locked update — the post-write call |
| `memory log VERB key=value` | Append one parseable operation line to `log.md` |
| `memory index` | Reconcile `index.md` against the pages actually on disk |
| `memory hot` | Regenerate `hot.md` within its word cap |
| `memory recap` | Print profile, open threads, and recent activity as one injectable block |
| `memory profile list\|set\|forget` | Durable facts about the vault owner |
| `memory todo list\|add\|done\|drop\|prune` | Open threads carried between sessions |
| `memory migrate` | Adopt a vault whose memory files predate this writer |

```bash
# After an ingest: one lock held across all three writes.
obsidian-wiki memory sync INGEST source=papers/attention.pdf pages_created=3

# Individually, when that is all you need.
obsidian-wiki memory log LINT issues_found=2 orphans=1
obsidian-wiki memory index
obsidian-wiki memory hot --takeaways "Retrieval is lexical; precision is the weak metric."

obsidian-wiki memory status --json
```

### What is generated and what is yours

`index.md` is **reconciled**, not overwritten. One section per category is regenerated from disk, and the preamble plus any section whose heading is not a category is preserved verbatim — a hand-written "Reading queue" section survives, a stale entry for a deleted page does not.

`hot.md` is generated except for `## Key Takeaways`, which is the one slot a model writes on purpose. It carries across every rebuild unless `--takeaways` replaces it; `--takeaways -` reads the prose from stdin.

The word cap is enforced. It defaults to 500, overridable with `OBSIDIAN_HOT_MAX_WORDS`, and counts content only — frontmatter and the generated-file note do not spend the budget. Over budget, sections are dropped in increasing order of value: activity lines first, then contradictions, then threads, and the takeaways are truncated last.

`--check` reports drift and exits **2** without writing, so a CI job can fail on a stale index without a bot committing to the vault. Exit 1 stays reserved for bad input, so a caller can tell the two apart.

![memory index --check as a CI gate](images/memory-check-gate.png)

### Adopting an existing vault

A vault created before this writer has hand-curated memory files: a custom `index.md` layout, a narrative `hot.md`. Regenerating those silently would reorder a document someone built on purpose and discard prose the generator cannot reconstruct.

So it refuses. `index.md` and `hot.md` are only written when they carry a `generated_by` marker, and `memory sync` on an unmigrated vault writes the log line (append-only, always safe), skips the other two, and says so on stderr. A fresh vault from `setup` is born marked, so this only affects upgrades.

```bash
obsidian-wiki memory migrate            # preview — changes nothing
obsidian-wiki memory migrate --apply    # back up, then adopt
```

![The migration preview](images/memory-migrate.png)

The preview names every section it will keep, whether your Key Takeaways carry across, and which threads it can rescue. `--apply` writes a timestamped backup to `_archives/pre-memory-migration-<ts>/` first.

Two things worth knowing:

- **Your sections stay on top.** The generated catalog is appended *below* whatever you already had, in its original order.
- **Narrative threads become real todos.** A hand-written `## Active Threads` list is parsed into the todo index before the rebuild, so the content survives as live entries instead of being replaced by "no open threads". Only when the todo table is empty — existing todos are never overwritten.

`doctor` reports migration state, so an upgraded install surfaces it without anyone going looking.

### Owner profile and todo index

Two tables under `_meta/`, both created empty by `setup`:

```bash
obsidian-wiki memory profile set stack "Python, FastAPI, Postgres" --confidence 0.85
obsidian-wiki memory todo add "Persist the retrieval index" --origin projects/obsidian-wiki.md
obsidian-wiki memory todo done t1
```

They are markdown tables so Obsidian renders them and a human can edit them in place; the parser round-trips hand edits, including values containing a literal `|`. Confidence is the writer's own calibration, not a measurement. Re-adding an open thread with the same text touches it rather than duplicating it.

Staleness is **reported, never enforced**. An open item untouched for 30 days is flagged by `memory todo list` and in `memory recap`; nothing closes it on your behalf.

### Session injection

`memory recap` is what the SessionStart hook (`wiki-session-recap.sh`) feeds into a fresh session, so the model starts with the owner profile and the open threads instead of having to remember to read `hot.md`.

`--project <name>` scopes threads and activity to one project; the hook derives it from the git repo name. Facts about the owner are global and always shown. A filter that matches nothing falls back to the unscoped view rather than implying there is no history.

The hook never breaks session startup: a missing vault, a missing install, an empty vault, or a slow filesystem all exit 0 with no output. Tune or disable it per session:

| Variable | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `WIKI_SESSION_RECAP` | *(on)* | `false` skips injection for this session |
| `WIKI_RECAP_MAX_WORDS` | `350` | Word budget for the injected block |
| `WIKI_RECAP_MIN_CONFIDENCE` | `0.0` | Drop profile facts below this confidence |
| `WIKI_RECAP_TIMEOUT` | `10` | Seconds before the recap is abandoned |

## Staged writes

With `WIKI_STAGED_WRITES=true`, skills write pages into `_staging/` for review instead of straight into the vault. These commands are the mechanical half of that workflow — `/wiki-stage-commit` calls them.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `staging list` | Inventory `_staging/`, with each file's kind and content revisions |
| `staging promote <path>` | Move a staged page to its live path |
| `staging discard <path>` | Move a staged file back to `_raw/rejected-…` |

```bash
obsidian-wiki staging list --json

# Promote a reviewed page, refusing if either side changed since you looked.
obsidian-wiki staging promote concepts/attention.md \
  --expect-staged 9f2c… --expect-live 41ab…

# A page that did not exist live when you reviewed it.
obsidian-wiki staging promote concepts/new-idea.md --expect-new

obsidian-wiki staging discard concepts/rejected-draft.md
```

Promotion is a rename, so the page that lands is byte-for-byte the one that was reviewed — arbitrary frontmatter, prose and wikilinks all survive untouched.

The revision flags are optional but are the point of the command: an agent can write to `_staging/` or to the live page while a human is mid-review. When a pin no longer matches, nothing moves and the command exits **9** with `conflict:` on stderr — distinct from exit 1 for bad input, so a caller can tell "re-read and ask again" from "you passed something wrong".

`.patch.md` files are listed with `kind: patch` and refused by `promote`: merging a human-readable diff into a page whose surrounding text may have moved is judgment, and belongs to the skill.

## Vault syncing

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `sync` | Stage, commit, and push pending vault changes |
| `sync-setup <remote>` | Configure GitHub sync (git init, `.gitignore`, remote) |

```bash
obsidian-wiki sync
obsidian-wiki sync-setup https://github.com/you/my-wiki.git
```

See [Configuration → Syncing your vault to GitHub](configuration.md#syncing-your-vault-to-github).

## Trust ledger

Records and validates human-approved confidence reviews, so you can gate on "a person actually checked these pages" in CI.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `trust-record` | Record explicitly approved manual confidence reviews |
| `trust-check` | Validate confidence values and material fingerprints against the ledger |

```bash
obsidian-wiki trust-record --all --reviewed-at 2026-07-30T10:00:00+00:00 --approved
obsidian-wiki trust-record --page concepts/rate-limiting.md --reviewed-at <ISO> --approved
obsidian-wiki trust-check --strict
obsidian-wiki trust-record @research --all --reviewed-at <ISO> --approved --allow-lifecycle active
obsidian-wiki trust-check @research --allow-lifecycle active --schema-source /vault/AGENTS.md
```

`--reviewed-at` needs a timezone. `--approved` is required and mandatory — it's your assertion that a human approved every confidence value being recorded. `trust-check --strict` is the CI/scheduled gate. `trust-record` and `trust-check` resolve the same vault-scoped schema as lint; pass the same lifecycle and required-field overrides to record and check. If the owner schema does not require `base_confidence`, pages without it are reported as `not_applicable`, excluded by `trust-record --all`, and any obsolete ledger entry is warned by `trust-check` then removed by `trust-record --page` or a rebuild. Both JSON and human-readable record output list excluded pages and removed obsolete entries; human output also emits a stderr warning when removal occurs. Required-field config accepts only `base_confidence`, `lifecycle`, `lifecycle_changed`, and `updated`; typos fail closed. Lifecycle, relationship-type, and required-field override values are stripped and empty or whitespace-only entries are rejected rather than added to an allowlist. Both commands skip tool-owned directories (dot-prefixed, `venv/`, `node_modules/`) and any path listed in the vault-root `.okignore`, so quarantine directories like `_excluded/` never enter the ledger. Without an explicit `--schema-source`, CLI overrides on an explicit vault are labeled `cli:explicit-vault`; combined CLI and config overrides use `cli+config:<resolved-config-path>`.

## Lower-level commands

Available for automation, scripting, and debugging. Skills call some of these internally.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `graph-query <vault> <question>` | Answer from the wikilink index without reading page bodies. Plain-English **structural questions** are answered from the graph and returned in a `graph` field: "what breaks if I delete X" (impact/blast radius), "which pages bridge my clusters" (betweenness), "what's central" (hubs), "what clusters do I have" (communities + cohesion), "surprising connections". |
| `graph-analyse <vault> [--top N] [--snapshot] [--diff-against FILE]` | Graph analysis in pure Python (the graphify algorithm family): god nodes (degree), bridge pages (Brandes betweenness centrality), communities with cohesion scores, cross-community surprising connections, suggested questions, and — with `--diff-against` a previous `_insights.md` — a graph diff. Vault bookkeeping files (`index`, `log`, `hot`, `_insights`) are excluded. |
| `graph-analyse <vault> --path A B` / `--around PAGE --depth N [--direction in\|out\|both]` | Query modes: shortest link path between two pages; N-hop neighbourhood of a page (`--direction in` = blast radius) |
| `batch-plan <vault> <source_dir>` | Split a source directory into parallel-ingest batches, skipping unchanged files |
| `cache-check <vault> <sources...>` | Which sources are new / modified / unchanged vs. `.manifest.json`. Vault-local sources no longer on disk are reported as `missing`; machine-local sources absent on this host (e.g. synced from another machine) are reported separately as `unavailable`. Covers hashed **file** sources only — a git repo is tracked under `projects` by commit, not by hash, so use `projects-check` for those |
| `cache-update <vault> <source> [--key <pseudo-key>] [--pages <page>...]` | Record a source's SHA-256 in `.manifest.json` after ingest. The stored key is normalised to a portable form; `--key` sets it explicitly (`repo:`/`url:`/`agent:`) for sources outside the vault and `$HOME`. If `_raw/_archived/<basename>` exists, that is the stored key and the file that is hashed — even when you pass a staging `_raw/<name>.md` path |
| `projects-check <vault> [--pretty]` | How far each `.manifest.json` `projects` entry has drifted from its checkout: `behind` (with a commit count), `current`, `unreachable` (the recorded sha no longer resolves or is no longer an ancestor — history was rewritten), `unsynced` (no `last_commit_synced` yet), `unavailable` (no usable checkout on this machine). Exits **2** when anything is `behind` or `unreachable`, so a scheduled run can branch on it; `unavailable`/`unsynced` exit 0, because an absent checkout is an absence of evidence, not a finding |
| `cache-hash <path>` | Compute a file or directory hash (no manifest I/O) |
| `ast-extract <path>` | Extract classes, functions, and imports from code — no LLM, no API calls |
| `code-understand --project <dir> [--backend auto\|builtin\|codegraph] [--since <sha>] [--changed <file>...] [--max-symbols N] [--pretty]` | Emit a ranked code-understanding focus map (symbols + file:line citations) for a project; CodeGraph when available, built-in AST + rg otherwise. `--backend` beats the resolved `CODE_UNDERSTANDING_*` config (env → project `.env` → global config).

### Manifest write safety

`.manifest.json` is a read-modify-write, and parallel ingest agents (`batch-plan` fan-out) or the Docker server writing while a local skill writes would otherwise clobber each other — losing a whole source entry silently.

`cache-update` therefore takes an advisory lock (`.manifest.lock` in the vault root, `O_CREAT|O_EXCL`, stdlib only so it works on Windows) and writes the manifest atomically via a temp file plus `os.replace`. A reader never sees a partial file, and a crashed writer's lock is stolen after 60 seconds.

In parallel runs, always update the manifest through `obsidian-wiki cache-update` rather than hand-editing `.manifest.json` — hand edits bypass the lock.

### Source keys and legacy migration

Manifest `sources` keys — and the `sources:` frontmatter on pages — are **portable**. A vault is synced across machines, so a stored key is one of:

| Source location | Key form | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Inside the vault | vault-relative | `Raw/papers/attention.pdf` |
| Under `$HOME` | `~`-relative | `~/.claude/projects/.../abc123.jsonl` |
| Not a file at all | pseudo-key | `url:https://example.com/article`, `repo:github.com/o/n`, `agent:claude/<id>` |

A pseudo-key is any `scheme:`/`://` identifier — the shape is what matters (it can never be mistaken for a file path), not a fixed list of names. Recommended names are `repo:` for a git remote, `url:` for a canonical URL, and `agent:` for a session log.

`cache-update` normalises the key automatically. Pass `--key` for a source with no portable path form — the explicit key is authoritative, and re-keys an entry the manifest previously tracked by path. If a source is outside the vault and `$HOME` and no `--key` is given, the absolute path is stored for backward compatibility but a `no portable key` warning goes to stderr.

To convert a manifest that already holds legacy absolute keys:

```bash
python3 "$OBSIDIAN_WIKI_REPO/scripts/manifest.py" migrate /path/to/vault --dry-run
python3 "$OBSIDIAN_WIKI_REPO/scripts/manifest.py" migrate /path/to/vault
```

`migrate` rewrites in-vault keys to vault-relative and `$HOME` keys to `~`-relative, merges collisions, and leaves pseudo-keys and unclassifiable paths untouched (warning on the latter). `normalize` is kept as an alias for older instructions.

**After moving a vault between machines**, its absolute keys are rooted at the *old* vault path, so neither the new vault root nor `$HOME` matches them and a plain `migrate` cannot strip anything. When that happens the summary says `nothing portable to write — N key(s) kept non-portable` (it never claims `already portable` while absolute keys remain) and tells you to pass the old root explicitly. Repeat the flag if the vault lived at more than one location:

```bash
python3 "$OBSIDIAN_WIKI_REPO/scripts/manifest.py" migrate /path/to/vault \
  --from-root /old/machine/path/to/vault --dry-run
```

`--from-root` takes precedence over the current-vault/`$HOME` rules for keys under it. It does not help with keys from *outside* any vault (e.g. another host's `~/.claude` or `~/.hermes` cache): those have no portable path form, so record them with an explicit key (`agent:` or your own scheme) instead.

`python3 scripts/manifest.py delta <vault> --scan '<glob>'` lists new/modified sources, honouring `WIKI_SKIP_PROJECTS`.

### Graph cache

Betweenness centrality (the `bridges` metric) is the only expensive computation in the
graph layer — O(V·E), roughly 0.3s on a 500-page vault but ~43s at 5 000 pages. Every
other metric stays under a second even on the largest vaults.

It is therefore memoised in `.graph-cache.json` at the vault root. The cache key is a
hash of the **graph topology itself**, not file timestamps, which has two consequences:

- Editing a page's prose without changing its links keeps the cache valid.
- Adding, removing, or retargeting any link changes the key, so a stale hit is impossible.

The file is only written when the computation actually took longer than 0.5s, so small
and medium vaults never accumulate one. It is bounded to the 3 most recent keys, written
atomically (safe under concurrent runs), and ignored if corrupt — deleting it is always
safe. Running `graph-analyse` warms the same cache that `graph-query` reads, so a nightly
`daily-update` removes the first-query cost entirely.
